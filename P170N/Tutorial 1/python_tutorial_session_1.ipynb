For example, the position of a particle moving in one dimension in classical mechanics can take any value on the real line, so in this case, it is appropriate to use a `float` to represent its value when you're doing computations in Python.  On the other hand, in quantum mechanics, when one is taking linear combinations of basis vectors in the state space of a system, the coefficients in this linear combination can in general be complex numbers, so in this case it would be appropriate to use the `complex` number type for these coefficients."

The `print` function takes some python expression as its input, and outputs the value of that expression.

    "Among the most important motivations for writing your own python functions is the goal of writing **modular** code.  This means writing code that comes in reasonably small pieces, each of which performs a specific task.  There are any advantages to writing modular code, among the most important are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If code is modular, then each segment of the code can be individually developed and dubugged before being used in an entire program.  This way, if the program isn't working properly, one can be reasonably certain that the properly debugged piece of code is not the culprit.\n",
    "2. If code is modular, then one can separate what a certain segment of code does from the precise implementation -- the way in which it accomplishes its tasks.  This means that if at a future date, one finds a better way of achieving that task, one needs only change an isolated piece of code with the new implementation instead of writing the whole thing over again.\n",
    "3. Writing modular code makes it easier to plan and explain the logic of the code.  By breaking the code up into small pieces, each of which performs a specific function, one can focus on implementing each piece of code one at a time once the logic is layed out as opposed to having to think about the entire code all the time.  Also, when someone is trying to understand the code, they don't necessarily need to understand every line to get what it's doing, they'll just need to understand how all the various smaller pieces fit together.  If they want to delve into the nitty gritty implementation of each piece, they are free to do so, but they don't have to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing your own functions is a specific way of making code modular.  A function is an object that takes in certain inputs, does something potentially complicated to these inputs, and then returns an output.  By writing a function to perform a task, you can use this function to perform that task again and again without having to copy and paste the full code for each instance of the task."

The word `def` is then followed by a single space and then the name of the function.  Adjoined to the name of the function are a set of parenthesis that enclose the labels one wishes to use for the argument(s) of the function, and a colon follows.  After the colon, one needs to go to the next line, and indent four spaces to tell the interpreter what's in the body of the function.  The body of the function can contain any code you wish, and if you want the function to output a certain value, then that output is specified by the statement `return` followed by whatever you want the output to be.  Note that a function does not need to return anything, so one can leave the return statement blank.\n",
