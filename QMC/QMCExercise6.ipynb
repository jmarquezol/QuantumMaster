    "# Exercise 6: Variational Monte Carlo simulation of a harmonic oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Find the best approximation for the ground state energy and wave function of a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hamiltonian of a single particle of mass m in a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with frequency $\\omega$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{H}=-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}+\\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^{2}x^{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ground-state energy in a 1D oscillator is different from zero, $E_{0}=\\hbar\\omega/2$, due to quantum fluctuations, contrary to the classical case with zero minimal energy at $T=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will use dimensionless units and express all energies in units of $\\hbar\\omega$ and all distances in units of $r_{0}$ defined such that $\\hbar^{2}/mr_{0}^{2}=m\\omega^{2}r_{0}^{2}=\\hbar\\omega$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase space is simple here, here $R=x$, as there is only one degree of freedom. Although integrals of a single variable can be conveniently calculated by deterministic methods, it is instructive to calculate them by means of Monte Carlo techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will choose the trial wave function in the following form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\psi_{T}(x;\\alpha,\\beta)=exp(-\\alpha|x|^{\\beta}) \\quad (2.1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha>0$ and $\\beta>1$ are variational parameters. The local energy contains two contributions, coming from the potential and kinetic energies,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. potential energy $\\frac{x^{2}}{2}$\n",
    "2. kinetic energy, estimator (1)\n",
    "   $$-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{f_{1}^{\\prime\\prime}(x)}{f_{1}(x)}$$\n",
    "3. kinetic energy, estimator (2):\n",
    "   $$+\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{f_{1}^{\\prime}(x)}{f_{1}(x)}\\right)^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "here the one-body term is $f_{1}(x)=exp(-\\alpha|x|^{\\beta})$ Its logarithmic derivatives are: $f_{1}^{\\prime}(x)/f_{1}(x)=-\\alpha\\beta|x|^{\\beta-1}$; $f_{1}^{\\prime\\prime}(x)=-\\alpha\\beta(\\beta-1)|x|^{\\beta-2}+(\\alpha\\beta|x|^{\\beta-1})^{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. generate a random initial configuration\n",
    "2. make a loop over Monte Carlo iterations\n",
    "3. move the point $R\\rightarrow R^{\\prime}$ in the phase space. for example, each particle can be displaced according to a random flat $(r_{i}\\rightarrow r_{i}+(2\\xi-1)\\Delta)$ or Gaussian $(r_{i}\\rightarrow r_{i}+\\xi)$ distribution\n",
    "4. accept or reject the move according to the Metropolis algorithm. For example, throw a random number $\\xi\\in(0,1)$ and accept the move if $p(R^{\\prime})/p(R)>\\xi$.\n",
    "5. accumulate the local energy and its square (energy: energy + local_energy; energy2 = energy2 + local_energy * local_energy); density profile;\n",
    "6. after Niter iterations are done, estimate the mean energy $(\\langle E\\rangle\\approx energy/Niter)$, its variance: $\\sigma_{E}^{2}=\\langle E^{2}-\\langle E\\rangle^{2}\\rangle\\approx$ energy2/Niter - (energy/Niter)**2 and its statistical error $\\epsilon_{E}=\\sigma_{E}/\\sqrt{N_{uncorr}}$ where $N_{uncorr}$ is the number of uncorrelated measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks to be completed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. fix variational parameter $\\alpha$ to (a) $\\alpha=1$ (b) $\\alpha=1/2$ and explore how the variational energy depends on the second parameter $\\beta$. Plot the obtained dependence of the energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find the optimal value of $\\beta$ for (a) $\\alpha=1$ (b) $\\alpha=1/2$ so that the variational energy is minimal for this value of $\\beta$. Report the best variational result for the energy and its statistical error $(E\\pm\\epsilon)$ using two estimators for the kinetic energy. Show the density profile calculated for the optimal parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Note that now the class of used functions contains the exact solution. How different is the behavior of the first and second estimators of the kinetic energy for the exact solution? What can be concluded about the variance?"
